# DATATHON2024

I have participated in a project as part of the Datathon 2024, a data competition organized in collaboration with Google and the Entrepreneurship Foundation in Turkey. The dataset provided for this competition is real data from the Entrepreneurship Foundation. The Foundation assigns an evaluation score to individuals applying to its programs, and while these scores are available in the training dataset, they are missing in the test dataset. My goal is to predict the most accurate evaluation scores for the individuals in the test dataset.
